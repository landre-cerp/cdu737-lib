# CDU 737 Library

THIS IS Still A WIP
NOT READY FOR USE AT THE MOMENT

I plan to build a library for interfacing with the CDU 737

- read CDU key press
- write to CDU display

  - higher level functions for writing text to lines, with colors

  Keep in mind that the device is limited in displayable chars.

  See [CDU 737 Wiki](https://github.com/landre-cerp/cdu737-lib/wiki) for more details.
